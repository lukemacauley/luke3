<p>TWO YEARS. IT MIGHT NOT SEEM LIKE A LONG TIME TO TURN AN IDEA  INTO A WORLD-CLASS LUXURY GOOD. BUT A LOT HAS HAPPENED IN THESE LAST TWO YEARS, STARTING ON THAT COLD WINTER DAY MY WALLET FELL APART, THE HOUSE REFUSED TO EXCHANGE IT,  AND I LEARNED THAT LUXURY ISN’T WHAT IT SHOULD BE ANYMORE. I researched the saddle-stitch, only to be disappointed by the brand most famous for the technique. I rejected samples made by a famous atelier in England who had done work for the Queen. I flew to Qatar to meet with a former executive for LVMH, who tried to dissuade me. I traveled to the Lineapple leather fair in Italy, where I learned trade secrets from the few tanneries owned by all the major luxury brands (why not to get your products made in Italy, for one). I followed the exotic skins trail to an atelier on the outskirts of Paris who makes the best goods for the world’s best brands, teaching myself French solely to communicate with her. And, at the end of it all, I had the world’s best materials, a quote for my first capsule collection, and an idealist’s understanding of what it takes to make the finest leather goods money can buy.</p>

<p>Today, I am proud to share what two years’ work looks like. 50 wallets. 100 cardholders. All matte black python, with black goatskin lining. The python is bespoke matte from a tannery owned by Hermes, as even their standard finish isn’t matte enough; I ordered extra skins to ensure only the very best parts of these grade one snakeskins would be used. Our goatskin lining is better than what you’ll find on the outer of a lot of luxury handbags; it cost us almost as much as the python. To hold and behold such a wallet is to understand that no expense was spared.</p>

<p>And so, Luke Macauley is launching with just 150 pieces of the finest leather goods it is possible to make. We pride ourselves on selling them at the lowest margins in the industry, like we pride ourselves on the idea of quality speaking for itself. WHILE MOST BRANDS PRODUCING LEATHER GOODS AT THIS LEVEL HAVE A 10x markup or higher, it makes anything but the base model, typically coated-canvas for most brands, not easily afforded. By selling directly to our clients exclusively through our web shop, we are able to deliver these goods at only 2.5x markup, which is unheard of in the luxury world. There is no “Luke Macauley,” no “Made In France” embossed anywhere on these pieces.  We do not brand our products; the branding is in the details. We use the most exquisite materials, and produce in the best factory in the world. After two years, I’ve learned that is enough.</p>
